Bear Force One -- the 2019 CSC 415 Group Project

Development Feedback Session on April 18th. 

Final Commit Due at 10:50 am on LAST DAY OF CLASS.

ALL branches to appear in the final version should be merged with the master
by that time by the repo masters.

Each person needs to prepare to give a 3 to 5 minute summary of what they did 
in the project.  We will then play the game in class.
